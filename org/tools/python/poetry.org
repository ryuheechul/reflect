#+title: Poetry

* basic usage
https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/

* with direnv
https://github.com/direnv/direnv/wiki/Python

=layout_poetry()= can be added directly to =.envrc= as well as =~/.direnvrc=. (managing =direnv= with (nix) =home-manager= makes it not trivial to manage =~/.direnvrc= with VCS)

additionally include =poetry env use pythonX.X= if default version is different.

i.e. defualt installed version via global `nix` is python3.9
then install python3.7 (=python37= in nix package) possibly via =shell.nix=

and include =poetry env use python3.7= somewhere makes sense at =.envrc=

* misc issues
