#+title: Zsh

* on macOS
** Don't install zsh with Homebrew
/Instead I install via [[https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=zsh&query=zsh][Nix]] which allows me to avoid issues below./

*** Problems with multi user
https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/issues/433

There seems to be a workaround - https://brendanthompson.com/til/2021/07/multi-user-homebrew.
But I would avoid that when possible.

*** Performance issue
Very noticeable lag on typing when brew-installed zsh is used with this particular plugin, https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete at least at the time of writing this.
/This might be not related to homebrew version and maybe it's solely up to the plugin/
