** OpenWRT
- [[https://gist.github.com/ryuheechul/e829b7846a965638deeb122bdd0b403c][How to "Install" an OpenWRT VM in Proxmox with UEFI]]
- add a new bridge for a lan that openwrt manages
- passthrough hardware, in my case wireless card
  - =opkg install pciutils= and =lspci -c=
  - install kernel module, =opkg install kmod-mt7921e=
    - driver failed why? =hardware init failed= from =dmesg=
- allow luci access from WAN
  - blocked by default for security but in this case, WAN is a LAN that I control
  - this can be blocked again once after the LAN is accessible to other devices that are outside proxmox
    - e.g. wireless lan (via wireless nic passthrough)
  - another way to circumvent this
    - ssh into a virtual machine on Proxmox that is connected to openwrt's lan
      - run =firefox -no-remote= and use that browser to access to openwrt's ip (in the lan)
        - this lazyway works without much setup upfront (but you still need X11 forwarding working though)
          - but the performance of the browser over SSH is slow, SSH tunneling would better option

- ok about the passthrough to the VM.... it didn't work both with openwrt and nixos vm (even with all these passthrough related kernel options - turns out they are not necessary at least with my current version with proxmox)
  - however when I tried with nixos live image, it worked!!! but as soon as I installed to the disk it stopped working...
    - however! thanks to reverse engineering, I was able to see there is [[https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=23.11&show=hardware.enableAllFirmware&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=enableallfirmware][hardware.enableAllFirmware]] and using [[https://discourse.nixos.org/t/see-changes-between-two-generations/2469/4][nix-diff]] was helpful to see that there is hint on what's missing on guest os side mainly on some firmware.
      - and =enableAllFirmware= indeed solved the problem on NixOS
  - with openwrt's luci interface searching with =mediatek= resulted with =kmod-mt7922-firmware= (requiring clicking =update lists=) which wasn't listed at https://openwrt.org/packages/index/kernel-modules ...
    after that no more failure message (=hardware init failed=) from =dmesg=!
- =wifi= doesn't start up on boot
  - both interface and wireless saying that it's not associated or device not active something like that
    - seems to be =wifi= doesn't get to be loaded
  - solution
     #+begin_src bash
       # adding this to /etc/rc.local via https://forum.openwrt.org/t/wifi-does-not-turn-on-automatically-on-startup/186127/9
       sleep 10
       wifi
     #+end_src
- WWAN redundancy (as client)
  - debug with =/etc/config/network= and =/etc/config/wireless=
  - just make sure when you scan and join network don't choose existing =wwan= create a new one per upstream ssid
  - also don't click =add= button as this seems for adding master =SSID= to accept client
- openwrt as wireless router!
  - need wireless master setup
    - WPA2-PSK (where is WPA3 btw?) requires =hostapd=
      - use =opkg= or luci to install it
      - or [[https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/encryption#atheros_and_generic_mac80211_wi-fi][wpad]] might be better choice to replace =hostapd= and =wpa-supplicant= packages
      - rebooting seems to be required for luci to pick it up properly after installing these pacakges
  - there is an issue with my specific card? https://github.com/openwrt/mt76/issues/708
    - that means the current stable release (24-05) is not patched yet
    - =lspci -v= shows that driver was not loaded
      - =iw list= seems to be a way to debug
    - is also using =hostapd= + =wpa-supplicant= instead of =wpad= required?
      - there was also booting issue after a reboot and it's solvable via rebooting proxmox (may need hard reboot after shutting off?)
