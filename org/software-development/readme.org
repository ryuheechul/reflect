#+title: Software Development - Readme

* Dependency Specification
We often see some additional characters before (or after) ([[https://semver.org/][semantic]]) version numbers like these:
=^=, =~=, =*=, =<[=]=, =>[=]=.

More thoughts on semantic versioning is found at https://jolynch.github.io/posts/semver_considered_harmful/.

They are often refer to as version constraints.

** Version Constraints
It doesn't appear to be that there is just only one true meaning on those constraints. Rather it's up to each pacakage management tool like below.
- [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html][Cargo (Rust)]]
- [[https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/][Python Poetry]]
- [[https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/version-constraints][Terraform]]
- [[https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning][NPM (JavaScript)]]
  - [[https://semver.npmjs.com/][NPM SemVer Calculator]]

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing][Shift Left Testing]]

Simply put, test early (shift testing phase to left) to get benefits of testing early on and avoid pitfalls of missing (or adapting late) tests in the pipeline.
