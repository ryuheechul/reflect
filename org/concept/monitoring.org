* Open Metrics
https://openmetrics.io/
Basically Prometheus format evolved into open metrics format so this format can be used more widely at different tools

* Open Telemetry
https://opentelemetry.io/

OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your softwareâ€™s performance and behavior.

OpenTelemetry is generally available across [[https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/][several languages]] and is suitable for use.

* Open Metrics and Open Telemetry together
They both are CNCF projects

So a meaning of OpenTelemetry and Open Metrics could be like using a OpenTelemetry client (i.e. [[https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/getting-started/nodejs/][NodeJS]]) to export metrics (i.e. instead of =prom-client=) and the Open Metrics format could be ingested into different backend (i.e. Datadog)
