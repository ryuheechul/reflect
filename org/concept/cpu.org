p-type silicon has a potential for electron to flow in (this doesn't mean it automatically becomes postively charged)
n-type silicon is the opposite of above

npn combination makes p-type to be negatively charged and this becomes non-conductive
(because the electron from n-types moved to the p-type)

but when a small positive voltage is applied to the floating gate the npn combination becomes conductive

what makes p-type and n-type silicon?

p: silicon + x doping
n: silicon + y doping
