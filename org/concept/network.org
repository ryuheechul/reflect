* (Cloud) Solutions
** Compare Services Between Major Cloud Providers

** Service Mesh
- help visualize/track traffics between services
- (Envoy) proxy components usually sits next to each target nodes
- telemetry (tracing, logging, metrics) can be done at proxy level, leaving apps being free of concerning on those things
- especially benefitial if apps are powered by different languages/platforms
- control plane can do all the magic of swapping routes and all kinds of stuff by controlling proxies
- which makes it easier to migrate services to different technologies and platforms
- suitable for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East-west_traffic][East-west traffic]] aka "internal" traffic between micro-services in modern setup.

** Service Discovery
- provide namespaces and aliases to understand each service much clearer without having to know which specific tech/platform each service is running on
- can provide not just access point but also addtional attributes like port number, database name, where to retrieve secrets
- which helps decoupling by reducing hard coding to actual values
- and that also enables smooth migrations as the only place need to update the value is SD
