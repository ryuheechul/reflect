  - mind blowing fact, parallel curcuit of 10ohm, 20ohm, 2ohm, 3ohm result in 1ohm in total
    - this means to get the least resistance the best way is trying multiple routes instead of facing potentially huge resistance in just one route (probably not just for electricity)
      - like applying multiple job applications instead of one job and one company all the time
        - this means it's better (less resistance) to apply multiple more difficult (to get) jobs than applying for single easier (to get) job
        - replace current with the likelyhood of getting hired and replace ohm with the inverse of that
      - a caveat is that infinite ohm cancels the being multiple
        - imagine a single serial path is actually single path + infinite path with infinite ohm
