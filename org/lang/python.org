* Surprising behavior of python

** Value suddently becomes tuple with trailing comma
This one charecter of mistake cost me a few hours of debugging

#+begin_src python
❯ python
Python 3.9.11 (main, Apr 10 2022, 19:21:43)
[Clang 11.1.0 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> a = "hello",
>>> a
('hello',)
#+end_src

After experiencing this, I get why it becomes tuple (and I guess it can be handy sometime??) but it is something surprising for someone who doesn't write python code regularly...
