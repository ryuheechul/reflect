#+title: Elm

https://elm-lang.org/
briefly learned in 2017-2018
It was a great opportunity for me to be familiar with functional programming and getting a taste of haskell style code

My wedding invitation was built with Elm https://github.com/ryuheechul/save-the-date

Haven't used it for a while though.
